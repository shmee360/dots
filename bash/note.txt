find all programs that take a font size or dpi and delete them, then change
xrandr dpi using Luke Smith's .xprofile as an example
off the top of my head:
	st
	dwm
	dmenu
	dwmblocks (maybe?)
	chromium
	edge

sync bash profile and bashrc

sync xprofile and xinitrc

get a password manager

customize dmenu

notify-send and async dwmblocks

Battery:
15% - 0
35% - 1/4
65% - 1/2
85% - 3/4
100% - 1

dwm:
Implement restart with SIGHUP or look for patch
Figure out a way to move floating windows around
Alpha might be nice
