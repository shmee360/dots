# My Dotfiles

These will be quite disorganized for the time being, but hopefully they will
help me switch between computers more easily.

## Git
A program literally everyone needs. It has some basic authentication and gpg stuff, but it's still a bit messy. I've gotten used to my aliases.

## Stack
I haven't quite figured this one out, but I can at least maybe save the config
file for Haskell Stack?

## Neovim
I've lovingly crafted this horrific mess of a vimrc for about two years on
and off, but now I'm beginning to like it.

Something to consider will be automatic plugin manager installation like
[this](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.config/nvim/init.vim)

## TODO:
- [ ] neovim
	- [x] vimrc and basics
	- [ ] automated installer
- [ ] mpv
- [ ] bash
- [ ] xorg
- [ ] maybe some chromium stuff
- [ ] subtrees for my suckless forks (this will be really good to pull off)
