# My Dotfiles

These will be quite disorganized for the time being, but hopefully they will
help me switch between computers more easily.

## Git
A program literally everyone needs. It has some basic authentication and gpg stuff, but it's still a bit messy. I've gotten used to my aliases.

## Stack
I haven't quite figured this one out, but I can at least maybe save the config
file for Haskell Stack?

## TODO:
- [ ] neovim
- [ ] mpv
- [ ] bash
- [ ] xorg
- [ ] maybe some chromium stuff
- [ ] subtrees for my suckless forks (this will be really good to pull off)
